Introduction:
	AutoRestart-Reloaded plugin is just a "Messenger". It tells the players, when the server will
restart, or it is estimating when the server will restart. The server restarting functions are done by a
third party process such as the Batch file, Bash (.sh) file, or  MultiCraft.

Installation (Continued): (With MutliCraft)
	Go into your Scheduled Tasks inside your MultiCraft panel, and add a command where the server will
restart every certain amount of minutes/hours. (Make sure the interval is the same as your config.yml).
	Please note that I do not have MutliCraft to test this feature. If you have MultiCraft please message
me what you did for this plugin to work so I can refine these instructions.

Conclusion:
	I want to apologize for not updating the plugin as regularly, I have been busy with work, and school
so I'm never on my computereven for gaming, searching, or purchasing. The only reason I have used my PC
is for school. Thank you all for using my plugin, and I would love to visit your server seeing you use my
plugin. Enjoy this unique up-to-date plugin, and happy gaming.

Thank you.
