## Global Broadcast and Private Messages adds flexibility on what you want your players to see!
## You have the option of having the player who executed the event to see a message while other dont, or
## have the player who executed the event see a global message but not a private message, or both!
## you can have the server see a global message while the player who executed the command will see
## his own message.

## The reason why you can enable or disable broadcasts and popups, is to give you the flexibility to
## choose whether you want your players to see a broadcast or a popup of the event. Or both! If you have
## both popups and broadcasts disabled, broadcasts are automaticlly enabled. If broadcasts, private messages,
## and popups are all disabled, then it will aswell be automaticlly enabled in broadcasts. If broadcasts and
## private messages are disabled, but popups are enabled, console will get a private message for logs. Since
## command line cant recieve popups.
    
## These are global broadcasts the everyone sees. If the same task is enabled in "private_message"
##  the player who initiated the event will not see the broadcast, but will see his own broadcast.
##  Global broadcasts include the prefix in "main.prefix" config.

## You can also put the fade numbers to 0, and then the popup's will be instant!
## Get creative!
## Global Popups duplicate rules are applied just like global Messages, same situation with private popups
