This command will allow you to change the restart time in AutoRestart manually. The usage of this command is "/autore in [hours]:h [minutes]:m [seconds]:s." What the brackets mean, is that the argument is optional; However, for the command to execute you need at least one parameter entered. For example, you may type "/autore in 5:h 36:m 47:s, " and the server will restart in five hours, thirty-six minutes, and forty-seven seconds. Another example is "/autore in 5:m," will restart the server in five minutes. You may also try, "/autore in 4:h 360:m," and the plugin will do the calculation and restart the server in ten hours.
