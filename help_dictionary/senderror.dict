Hate having to go to SpigotMC, creating an account (if not already), private messaging the developer the error message, then waiting for a response? Do not worry anymore! This command will send that last error that you have caused to me via E-Mail. Yes, I do check my emails often... Note: You have to enter your email address and password in the configuration file for AutoRestart to send the email to me. (None of your information is sent, kept, or logged. If you do not feel comfortable using your email, you can stick to the old school way.)
