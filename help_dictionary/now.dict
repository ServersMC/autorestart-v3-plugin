This command will give you the opportunity to restart the server instantly. "/autore now," uses the same execution process as "/stop," but the difference is that AutoRestart will adequately notify and kick your players from the server with the configured restart message. As in the other hand "/stop," will close the server, restart because AutoRestart is backed up by a third party script, but kick your players with a "Server Closed," message. Try it out!
